# todosWithRedux

## Summary

Practice working with Redux (reducers, combineReducers, store, etc), React, and Parcel on a simple Todos List with an App.js file and index.html.

## Format

Also, standard Prettier and ESLint rc files for React, JavaScript, and JSX. The Prettier file has an empty object, which basically means go with appropriate format. The ESLint rc file contains more presets, like

```
"react": { "version" : "detect"}
```

which detects the version of React and formats appropriately.
